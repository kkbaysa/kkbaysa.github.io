	            	My name is Kaitlyn Baysa. I am a junior studying IT Innovation at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am also minoring in Spanish to offset some of the programming-heavy classes that I am in. I really enjoy languages, so being in IT Innovation links both of these interests up. Right now, I am studying the topic of increasing diversity within STEM topics.

	            In my free time, I am a basketball coach for a sixth grade girls basketball team. I also play on an intramural basketball team at UNO. Around Omaha, I like to explore all of the different coffee shops for both the coffee and the atmosphere. I will never get bored of the Omaha zoo and the Old Market. Check out my Favorite Places in Omaha page if you want to see more of my favorite places in Omaha!

	            I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures. My favorite places that I have traveled to are Hawaii, the Dominican Republic, and Spain.
