            My name is Kaitlyn Baysa. I am a junior studying IT Innovation at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am also minoring in Spanish to offset some of the programming-heavy classes that I am in. I really enjoy languages, so being in IT Innovation links both of these interests up.

            In my free time, I am a basketball coach for a sixth grade girls basketball team. I like spending time with my friends and family. I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures.
